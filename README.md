# :coffee: javabbreviations-vim
Vim mappings and abbreviations for Java Development, heavily inspired by IntelliJ 


## :warning: work in progress:
still under development, at the moment it's better to not install it


## Mappgins

| Snippet for  | IntelliJ Shortcut | javabbreviations-vim mapping  |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| public constructor | `Alt + Insert` | `<leader>pc` |
| test method | `Alt + Insert` | `<leader>jt` |
| setup method | `Alt + Insert` | `<leader>st` |
| teardown method | `Alt + Insert` | `<leader>td` |

## :dart: goal:
implement some of the `alt + insert` snippets and find a way to get some of the `refactor -> extract` functionality
